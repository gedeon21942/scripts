# Explanation of the command:
# ssh "$USERNAME@$HOSTNAME"  : Connects to your Unraid server via SSH.
# "virsh start \"$VM_NAME\"" : This is the command executed on the remote Unraid server.
#                              - virsh: The command-line tool for libvirt.
#                              - start: The virsh subcommand to start a VM.
#                              - \"$VM_NAME\": The VM name. Crucially, if your VM name has spaces,
#                                             you MUST enclose it in double quotes, and those
#                                             quotes need to be escaped for the local shell
#                                             so they are passed to the remote shell.

# --- Optional: Check VM status afterwards ---
